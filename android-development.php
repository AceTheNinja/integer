                                <h2>What is <a>Android Development</a> : </h2>
                                <p>A mobile software application developed for use on devices powered by Google's Android platform.  Android apps are available 
                                    in the <a>Google Play Store </a>(formerly known as the Android Market), in the Amazon Appstore and on various Android App-focused sites,
                                    and the apps can run on Android smartphones, tablets, Google TVand other devices.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As with Apple and its Apple App Store apps, Google encourages developers to program their own <a>Android apps</a>.  While many Android
                                    apps can be freely downloaded, premium apps are also available for purchase by users, with revenues for the latter shared between
                                    <a>Google</a> (30%) and the software developer (70%).  Additionally, some <a>Android Apps</a> follow the freemiumbusiness model, wherein 
                                    the app developer can derive revenue on free apps via Google's in-app billing capabilities.
                                </p>

                                <h2>10 Reasons Why <a>Android</a> Will Make Your Small Business Fly : </h2>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><a>It’s more affordable</a> – You’re probably not the kind of person that can shell out cash on any proprietary 
                                        material that’s thrown at you. That’s why you need to think about the cold hard cash you’re spending. Since Android 
                                        OS is affordable, you’ll find phones costing anything from $200-600 running the software. While the iPhone 4 might
                                        have fallen down to just below $100, that doesn’t change the fact that the phone has barely any capability of
                                        interacting with non-Apple devices.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><a>You have more choices</a> – How many phones run iOS? Like 5? Compare that to the numerous amount of Android-based 
                                        phones. The choices are limitless!
                                    </li>
                                    <li><a>Open source software</a> – Who said you have to use your Android phone as it comes right out of the box? It’s easy 
                                        to develop a business application on it with your own branding. You can even modify the operating system to include
                                        your business’ brand on it. That gives you tons of kudos in the business world.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><a>Affordable development</a> – To get your own app out there, you don’t need to pay exotic licensing and development 
                                        fees. The application environments are free of charge and you end up saving a ton of money if you want to make more 
                                        than one app for your business.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><a>Distribute anywhere</a> – With iOS apps, you need to use the Apple App Store. With Android apps, you don’t need any
                                        of that mumble jumble. Just publish the app where you wish. There’s no “empire” looking over your shoulder.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><a>High customer demand</a> – The fact the OS is popular in itself becomes a reason to use it, sometimes. Android
                                        is literally roaring in demand and customers are going after these phones in giant herds.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><a>Security</a> – Android is a pipeline-based system, much like Linux – which it’s based on. You’ve heard about how
                                        Linux is difficult to hack, right? Well, you can rest assured that the sensitive information you send to your 
                                        accountant won’t reach other eyes. iOS has its own security, but its applications might not be as secure as the
                                        operating system, since iOS doesn’t treat them as separate entities. Plus, Android is managed by its community, 
                                        while iOS is managed only by Apple. Who do you think can thwart an attack more easily?</li>
                                    <li><a>It does what iOS does</a> – OK, so Android doesn’t do everything that Apple’s prized OS does, but does Apple’s OS
                                        do everything Android can do? With Android’s “Ice Cream Sandwich” update, we’ve got ourselves a bonafide operating 
                                        system that doesn’t fall far from the apple tree (pun intended).
                                    </li>
                                    <li><a>Track data usage</a> – In these days, data is a precious resource, much like gasoline. Android’s Ice Cream Sandwich 
                                        let’s you have a look at intricate data usage statistics. This helps you prevent going over limits on your carrier.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><a>It’s by Google</a> – Let’s be honest: How likely are you to switch from Gmail to a service provided by Apple? Sure,
                                        iOS has a Gmail app, but it’s as inconvenient as an apple pie without the crust. Android’s Gmail app lets you manage 
                                        your account so well that you might end up forgetting to check your computer altogether. This can go hand-in-hand 
                                        with Google Apps’ Gmail services, which let you tie a company email to Gmail’s servers.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
