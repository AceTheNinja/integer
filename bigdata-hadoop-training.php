                                Organizations use their data to support and influence decisions and build data-intensive products and services,
                                such as recommendation, prediction, and diagnostic systems. The collection of skills required by organizations 
                                to support these functions has been grouped under the term 'data science'.
                                This statistics and data analysis course will attempt to articulate the expected output of data scientists

                            <p class="regular-text">
                                Big Data is a set of unstructured and structured data that is complex in nature and is growing exponentially with 
                                each passing day. Organizations are facing a major challenge in storing and utilizing this enormous data. 
                                This problem spans across the world because of a serious dearth of skilled programmers.
                                "The United States alone faces a shortage of 140,000 to 190,000 people with analytical expertise and 1.5 million managers 
                                and analysts with the skills to understand and make decisions based on the analysis of big data."-mckinsey.com

                                it requires careful analysis of the requirements, gathering information, preparing the necessary documentation 
                                which requires understanding the live project using Software Development Life Cycle. So you have to learn tricks 
                                to produce bulk output on time maintaining the right design quality or coding standard. That is the significance 
                                of Live Project Training. We assure that our Live Project Training will impart the confidence in students to work
