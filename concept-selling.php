                                <h2>Why this is a need of today? <a>Selling Concept</a> : </h2>
                                <p>
                                    This is another common business orientation. It holds that consumers and businesses, if left alone, will ordinarily not buy
                                    enough of the selling company's products.  The organization must, therefore, undertake an aggressive selling and promotion effort.  This concept assumes that consumers typically sho9w buyi8ng inertia or resistance and must be coaxed into buying.  It also assumes that the company has a whole battery of effective selling and promotional tools to stimulate more buying. Most firms practice the selling concept when they have overcapacity.  Their aim is to sellwhat they make rather than make what the market wants.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This business idea also projects the concept that it is essential to sell current resources in order to make room for the next
                                    wave of stock. Such an approach helps maintain inventory and keep a positive flow of resources heading out of a corporation.
                                    The thinking behind this maneuver is that this allows for new waves of resources to make their way to the retail location
                                    and offer something new to attract consumers who are not currently buying. This promotes a proactive approach to customer
                                    service and sales.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The whole philosophy of concept selling is to reach a new level of market place whom were unaware of the true benefits 
                                    of your products, services or solutions, prior to our initial contact with them. There are many benefits associated 
                                    with our concept selling approach, however, we recognise that they are based around the following principals:-
                                </p>
                                <ul>

                                <p>The five most important points of the selling concept of the marketing are describe hereunder: -</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>This concept is typically practiced with unsought goods (those that buyers do not normally think of buying e.g. insurance policies).</li>
                                    <li>The selling concept takes an "inside-out" perspective (focuses on existing products and uses heavy promotion and selling efforts).</li>
                                    <li>To be successful with this concept, the organization must be good at tracking down the interested buyer and selling them on product benefits.</li>
                                    <li>Industries that use this concept usually have overcapacity. Their aim is to sell what they make rather than make what will sell in the market.</li>
                                    <li>There are not only high risks with this approach but low satisfaction by customers.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    In other words; the aim is to sell what the company makes rather than making what the market wants. Such aggressive selling
                                    program carries very high risks.In selling concept the marketer assumes that customers will coaxed into buying the product 
                                    will like it, if they don’t like it, they will possibly forget their disappointment and buy it again later. This is usually 
                                    very poor and costly assumption. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Typically the selling concept is practiced with unsought goods. Unsought goods are that buyers do not normally think of
                                    buying, such as insurance or blood donations. These industries must be good at tracking down prospects and selling 
                                    them on a product’s benefits. 
                                    The focus here is more on selling the products of the company to consumers without comprehending the market needs 
                                    and increasing sales transactions rather than building and enhancing relationships with customers.
                                </p>
