                    <h2>What is <a>CMS</a> : </h2>
                    <p>A Content Management System (CMS) is a tool which enables you to easily create content for your website. There is usually
                        a secure admin area where you can log in, which provides simple tools such as a text editor and file manager for adding
                        and maintaining your website’s content.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        INTEGER Innovation provides individual approach to each project in our company. Don't expect we are another agency that
                        outsources to save on development. Have no doubt that you have the team where all the work is distributed among certain 
                        specialists (designers - design, programmers - develop).
                        </p>
                        
                        <h2>5 Ways a CMS Will HELP Your Business : </h2>
                        <p>
                            1.	<a>Increase efficiency</a> – Content can be publishing easily and efficiently as editing and revisions do not 
                            require visual design or coding knowledge. This allows for fast and efficient updates, saving your business 
                            cost and time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            2.	<a>Increase your search engine ranking</a> – To improve or maintain your search engine ranking your business has to
                            remain relevant, and a good and easy-to-use CMS will help your publishers keep the content fresh.  This invites 
                            external contribution (e.g. comments, forum, likes etc…), an integral component in staying relevant and improving
                            your search engine ranking.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            3.	<a>Maintain control over your content</a> - Workflow is a core feature of any good CMS. Irrespective of how basic
                            your workflow needs might be, workflows will ensure your business maintains control over content.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            4.	<a>Help your visitors in their search for information</a> – With powerful CMS search engines new content is indexed 
                            automatically so it can be instantly found. Visitors can also use taxonomy applications, sorting lists, saved searches
                            and more to personalize the search experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            5.	<a>Cross-selling</a> – Sophisticated Content Management Systems can learn user behaviour and preferences,
                            making your cross-selling and up-selling efforts much more cost effective.
                        </p>
