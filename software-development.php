                                <h2>What INTEGER Innovation means for software development industry?</h2>
                                <p>We place software development into 6 buckets:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><a>Applications Development</a> Designing and coding software which is used by humans to solve a particular
                                        practical problem. For example, the developers in a company’s IT department may write a tool designed to help the
                                        sales staff manage sales data. The term “applications development” usually implies non-Web based software. 
                                        The most common languages used by applications developers are Java, Visual Basic, VB.NET, and C#.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><a>Systems Development</a> Designing and coding software which works behind the scenes. For example, several 
                                        thousand engineers who work at Microsoft developing the Windows operating system are systems developers. A 
                                        subcategory is API development, where engineers write code which is intended to be used by other developers
                                        who are writing application programs. The most common languages used by systems developers are C and C++.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><a>Web Development</a> : Designing and coding applications which are housed in a Web browser such as Internet Explorer,
                                        Netscape Navigator, or Firefox. For example, an online shopping system such as amazon.com is an example of Web 
                                        development. The most common languages used by Web developers are HTML, VBScript, PHP, JavaScript, VB.NET, and C#.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><a>Embedded Systems Development</a> : Designing and coding software which works on non-computer devices. For example,
                                        engineers who write programs which control the guidance systems of military devices are writing embedded systems code. 
                                        The most common languages used by embedded systems developers are Assembly Languages, C, and special one-of-a-kind languages.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><a>Scientific Development</a> : Designing and coding software which is primarily numerical. This type of programming
                                        is much less common than it used to be. The most common languages used by scientific programmers are C and C++.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><a>Test Automation</a> : Designing and coding software which tests other software. Microsoft employs thousands of 
                                        these engineers who have job title Software Design Engineer in Test, or SDET for short. The most common programming
                                        languages used by test engineers are Perl, Visual Basic, VB.NET, and C#.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><a></a> : 
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                <h2>How INTEGER Innovation tailors your custom software modules ?</h2>

                                <p>
                                    Six benefits that can be realized by your business should you choose to utilize custom software.
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The most important benefit of custom application development is that it is tailor-made by developers to 
                                        your specifications in order to best serve your business’ needs. It is not unusual for businesses to license
                                        software from a software vendor and then discover that it is simply not suitable for their business. With 
                                        custom business software, you will be guaranteed that the software makes a great fit for all of your 
                                        business’ requirements.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Custom business software is more scalable than off-the-shelf software packages. Since custom software developers
                                        operate on a contractual basis, they will continue to maintain the program as your business grows in size. 
                                        With off-the-shelf software, you typically run into the issue of the software either being inexpensive to
                                        purchase but not suitable for large businesses or software being able to support businesses on a large 
                                        scale but very expensive to license. Custom software development meets the needs of your company while 
                                        allowing your business to grow without being limited by your software.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Custom software development can help protect your business from external threats. The majority of successful
                                        hacking attempts performed on business are as a result of hackers exploiting known software vulnerabilities
                                        in commonly-used software. Custom software will be a much less attractive target for hackers as it will 
                                        require comparatively much more effort to learn how to breach the system.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Custom application development is capable of operating with the software packages your business already uses. 
                                        It is almost never the case that multiple off-the-shelf software packages interact with each other perfectly
                                        and without errors; licensing business software that is not tailor-made for the software environment your
                                        business runs on can lead to your employees’ productivity dropping as they experience continual errors and
                                        cannot effectively complete their work. Custom software development avoids this problem, as it can fit 
                                        perfectly within your business’ software ecosystem.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>With custom application development, your software is maintained for as long as you require it to be. With 
                                        off-the-shelf software, your business is at the mercy of the software developer you are purchasing from; 
                                        if they go bankrupt or decide to no longer maintain the application, your business will be put in the
                                        position of suddenly needing to change to maintained and supported software. This can be a debilitating
                                        sudden expense for your business.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Custom business software helps you save on hardware acquisition costs. Licensing software packages often
                                        means purchasing extra hardware to go with it in order to run it effectively. Custom software developers
                                        will tailor the program to both the vendor of your hardware and your hardware’s capabilities. This ultimately
                                        helps your business save money, as you will not need to purchase unnecessary additional hardware.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                    The role of custom software development has increased for the recent years since every software company tries
                                    its best to keep up a friendly relationship with its clients by offering customized solutions to the diverse 
                                    requirements. While business organizations are exerting every effort to take the industry leading place, 
                                    a stereotype product with the identical old functionalities can decrease their advanced chances.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    User-friendly or custom-built software is supposed to be the most appropriate choice nowadays, to guarantee exclusiveness
                                    in business issues. The chief purpose of custom software development is to produce as much perfect outcome as required
                                    by the client. An especially custom-made product should be developed after comprehension of the client’s preferences and requisites.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Customized packages are contrived by utilizing the latest up-to-date technology. The products are developed exceptionally
                                    to satisfy the client’s business requirements. Any discontent or difficulty of the client that appear during the
                                    development process can be improved while the formulation of the software with customer permission and that is
                                    the most significant benefit of the package development like this.
