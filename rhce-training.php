                                A large percentage of the servers hosting websites, cloud-based services and virtualization services are powered by
                                Linux. The Linux operating system is favored by many IT departments due to its reputation for stability, its open 
                                source model, and low cost of ownership.
                            </p>

                                During the course, students will work at their own pace through the complete set. The RHCE Certification Lab course
                                includes a few instructor lectures designed to review key technologies such as systemd, firewalld, and IPv6.
                                For the classroom and virtual classroom versions of this course, an instructor will be available throughout the 
                                week to assist students as they work through the labs.

                                certification, the student must pass the RHCSA exam.This course will provide specific examples that will help
