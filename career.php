                                Graphic Designers create visual concepts, using computer software or by hand, to communicate ideas that inspire, inform, and captivate consumers. They develop the overall layout and production design for various applications such as for posters.advertisements, brochures, magazines, and corporate reports.Graphic designers 
                                combine art and technology to communicate ideas through images and the layout of websites and printed pages. They may use a variety of design elements to achieve artistic or decorative effects.

                                Why Graphic Desinging is in market demand today?
                                Graphic design is important to marketing and selling products, and is a critical component of brochures and logos. Therefore, graphic designers, also referred to as graphic artists or communication designers, often work closely with people in advertising and promotions, public relations, and marketing.
                                Frequently, designers specialize in a particular category or type of client. For example, some create the graphics used on retail products packaging, still others may work on the visual designs used on book jackets. Graphic designers need to keep up to date with the latest software and computer technologies to remain competitive.
                                Some individuals with a background in graphic design teach in design schools, colleges, and universities.
