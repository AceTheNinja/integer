                                <h2>What is Business <a>ERP</a> Process : </h2>
                                <p>Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is <a>business process</a> management software that allows an organization to use a system
                                    of <a>integrated applications</a> to manage the business and automate many back office functions related to technology, 
                                    services and human resources. <a>ERP software</a> integrates all facets of an operation, including product planning, development,
                                    manufacturing, sales and marketing.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <a>ERP software</a> is considered an <a>enterprise application</a> as it is designed to be used by larger businesses and often requires
                                    dedicated teams to <a>customize</a> and analyze the data and to handle upgrades and deployment. In contrast, Small business 
                                    ERP applications are lightweight business management software solutions, customized for the business industry you work in.
                                </p>

                                <h2>ERP Software <a>Modules</a> : </h2>
                                <p>
                                    ERP software typically consists of multiple <a>enterprise</a> software modules that are individually purchased, based on 
                                    what best meets the specific needs and technical capabilities of the <a>organization</a>. Each <a>ERP module</a> is 
                                    focused on one area of business processes, such as product development or marketing. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    A <a>business</a> can use ERP software to manage back-office activities and tasks including the following:Distribution process 
                                    management, supply chain management, services knowledge base, configure, prices, improve accuracy of financial data, 
                                    facilitate better <a>project planning</a>, automate employee life-cycle, standardize critical business procedures, reduce redundant
                                    tasks, assess business needs, accounting and financial applications, lower purchasing costs, manage human resources and
                                    payroll.
                                    Some of the most common ERP modules include those for product planning, material purchasing, inventory control, distribution,
                                    accounting, marketing, finance and HR.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As the <a>ERP methodology</a> has become more popular, software applications have emerged to help <a>business managers</a> 
                                    implement ERP in to other business activities and may incorporate modules for <a>CRM</a> and business intelligence, 
                                    presenting it as a single unified package. The basic goal of using an <a>enterprise resource planning</a> system is to 
                                    provide one central repository for all information that is shared by all the various ERP facets to improve the flow of 
                                    data across the organization.
                                </p>

                                <p>Another trend in enterprise applications is the move to cloud computing, where the enterprise moves some or its entire infrastructure to the cloud -- a type of Internet-based computing, where services are delivered to an organization's computers and devices through the Internet as an on-demand service. Some enterprises may also choose a hybrid solution where cloud applications are integrated with on-premise systems.
                                    Some of the more common types of enterprise applications include the following:

                                <p>The ERP field can be slow to change, but the last couple of years have unleashed forces which are fundamentally shifting
                                    the entire area. According to Enterprise Apps Today, the following new and continuing trends affect enterprise ERP software:
                                </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><span><a>Mobile ERP : </a></span>
                                        <small>
                                            Executives and employees want real-time access to information, regardless of where they are. It is expected that 
                                            businesses will embrace mobile ERP for the reports, dashboards and to conduct key business processes.
                                        </small>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><span><a>Cloud ERP : </a></span>
                                        <small>
                                            The cloud has been advancing steadily into the enterprise for some time, but many ERP users have been reluctant to place data cloud. Those reservations have gradually been evaporating, however, as the advantages of the cloud become apparent.
                                        </small>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><span><a>Social ERP : </a></span>
                                        <small>
                                            There has been much hype around social media and how important – or not -- it is to add to ERP systems. Certainly, vendors have been quick to seize the initiative, adding social media packages to their ERP systems with much fanfare. But some wonder if there is really much gain to be had by integrating social media with ERP.
                                        </small>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><span><a>Two-tier ERP : </a></span>
                                        <small>
                                            Enterprises once attempted to build an all-encompassing ERP system to take care of every aspect of organizational systems. But some expensive failures have gradually brought about a change in strategy – adopting two tiers of ERP.
