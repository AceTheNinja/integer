                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    A website is an extension of your company and needs to be demonstrative of your brand. It should be informative and engaging
                                    for your <a>target user</a>. It will act as a catalyst for your marketing and promotional efforts: it’s a highly effective way to
                                    compete with or beat your competitor and expand your <a>business on international level</a>.
                                    Although there are several reasons why you should use the web in general as a platform for advertising and online marketing,
                                    we are mentioning here just a few benefits of having a website itself.
                                </p>

                                    services or featured products, and, if you implement a good Search Engine Optimization plan or Social Media Marketing 
                                    Strategy, it will attract your exact <a>target audience</a>, converting more clicks into sales.
