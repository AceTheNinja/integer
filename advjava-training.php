                                Live project is the phase when you finally implement most of the things that you have learnt during your software training. Software development is more than just coding. Before you write even a single line of code, it requires careful analysis of the requirements, gathering information, preparing the necessary documentation which requires understanding the live project using Software Development Life Cycle. So you have to learn tricks to produce bulk output on time maintaining the right design quality or coding standard. That is the significance of Live Project Training. We assure that our Live Project Training will impart the confidence in students to work on real time projects </p>
